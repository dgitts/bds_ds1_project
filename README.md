# Dallas-Fort Worth Short-Term Rental Investor Project

This project seeks to answer one question, are short-term rentals a good investment in DFW?
We analyze active property listings in the top 10 markets in the DFW area, and plot charts comparing industry KPI's for each market. As an investor you will be able to quickly look at the charts to decide for each market and area if a short-term rental would be an ideal investment.
